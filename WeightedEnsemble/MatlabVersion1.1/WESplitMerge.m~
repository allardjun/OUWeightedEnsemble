%Firstly, checks to make sure that there are replicas in the bin
%Second, while there are more replicas in the bin than necessary, we check
%to see how many replicas inside the bin share the smallest weight. If it's more than one,
%we combine the first two listed in the vector together. Otherwise, we
%combine the smallest with the first found second smallest.
